Partly financed by the French government and developed by Synaltic since 2015, Data-Asso still had no paying customers when I joined the team in September 2022 even though lots of work had been put in already. Employed as an intrapreneur, my mission was to help them implement the lean startup methodology to achieve product-market fit by refactoring the architecture for better flexibility, iteration speed, and learning.

With an architecture set up for robustness and scalability, the former stack was also hard to work with and monitor, leading to many issues such as slower development speed, unreliable performance, and occasional shutdowns. It probably was a good stack back in 2015, but new solutions geared toward entrepreneurship emerged and it was time when I arrived to move from micro-services to serverless. Migrating a whole stack is no easy task, but it took us less than 2 months to go from a saturated codebase on Vue2/Nuxt2/Vuex to a clean codebase on Vue3/Nuxt3/Pinia, from an old design with Bulma/Buefy/SASS to a whole new modern design with TailwindCSS/HeadlessUI/TailwindUI/StoryBook, and from a poorly managed analytics solution to a modern solution with GrowthBook for A/B testing.

Today, the project is still going through numerous iterations, but thanks to my work, testing new hypotheses is incredibly fast and we know we are getting closer to a great product every day.
