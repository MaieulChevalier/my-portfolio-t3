# Smart-brain — AI Face detector

- **Link:** [https://portfolio-smart-brain-boost.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-smart-brain-boost.vercel.app/)
- **Date**: June 2018 - December 2018
- **Technologies**: React, javascript, css, tachyons, nodeJS, REST, PostgreSQL, Knex, Heroku, AWS S3, PWA, Redux

My first full-stack project — it involved building a front-end client with React and a backend server with nodeJS and REST deployed on Heroku and images on AWS S3 buckets.

The goal was to build a face detector that can identify each face in a picture, such as the kind of face detectors that are used in social networks to identify people. This project has taught me a lot on a technical level about the technologies I used, but also more generally about full-stack architectures, the power of APIs, and data structures.
