My first full-stack project — involved building a front-end client with React and a backend server with nodeJS and REST deployed on Heroku and images on AWS S3 buckets.

The goal was to build a face detector that can identify each face in a picture, such as the kind of face detectors that are used in social networks to identify people. This project has taught me a lot on a technical level about the technologies I used, but also more generally about full-stack architectures and data structures.
