A one-week hiring challenge I passed successfully while I didn’t really know Vue and neither Nuxt. The specifications asked for a game written in NuxtJS where the user would race against an AI to finish writing a program with a history of the current games stored in a Vuex store and past games stored in a mongoDB cluster.

I had a lot of fun doing this little challenge and it reminded me about all the fun I had for my first coding challenge (coding challenge 14). It wasn’t much, but I think it reinforced my belief that coding and entrepreneurship are really profound and fun games to play and make a living of.
