My first real project on my own - no solutions provided.

I had to build, in less than one month, a memory game with **html, css and javascript only.**

Even though itâ€™s terrible code, his is one of my most exciting memory as a web developer. I saw this as a real challenge at the time since I had never worked on my own with technical challenges to solve and without a provided solution. I thought it would be hard to meet the one-month deadline but it eventually worked out pretty well and I managed to make it in about one week. I was so proud I remember showing it to everyone around me.

My biggest takeaway from this is by far that coding can be A LOT of fun when you challenge yourself to the next level. Today, even though I tend to work on projects a little bit more complex than this one, I try to keep the same Pareto 80/20 spirit of setting a clear and achievable one to two weeks goal, sprinting towards it, and seeing concrete results that can be incremented upon later on.
