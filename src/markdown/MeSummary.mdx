# My name's Maïeul and I like to solve big problems

Thanks to my childhood in Madagascar, one of the poorest and yet most beautiful countries on earth, I have cultivated an open and curious mind that I try to use wisely in order to make a meaningful difference in the world. Today, I am 25, I speak French, Chinese, and English fluently, I am a senior web developer with more than 5 years of intense experience, and I like to think of myself as an entrepreneur.

In 2018, with my strong desire to do something in this world, I got hooked on web development and entrepreneurship. I have spent countless hours coding ever since, and I’ve had the chance to start two online businesses that I ultimately failed to scale twice. I have learned a lot from these experiences, especially in web development, but also in project management, marketing, finance, and law, and more generally improved my problem-solving and research skills.

After 5 years of working on projects big and small, I think that my biggest strength resides in my ability to combine my web development skills and my thorough understanding of the lean startup methodology to effectively bring new, robust, and innovative web-based solutions that scale to market.

## Key Skills

Technically speaking, I think I am best at building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and at iterating toward product-market fit, although I also know a thing or two when it’s time to scale.

- I have worked with javascript and typescript extensively on most of the projects I’ve worked on, and I love using typescript if I can for the safety nets it provides.
- I have built responsive UIs with CSS/SASS and most of the major CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Material UI, Bulma, Tailwind), my favorite one being tailwind for the productivity and flexibility that it brings to create a custom design system.
- I have built different websites with all the major front-end frameworks (React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, Remix, Solid.js, Astro), my favorite one still being React for its rich ecosystem, and I love using Next.js with it for the great developer experience that it brings.
- I have built many Node.js APIs both with REST and graphQL, though I recently fell in love with tRPC.
- I have experience with all major databases types such as SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), object-oriented databases (MongoDB), graph databases (neo4j), and key/value stores (Redis); I know when to use one and not the other and I have my ideas on how to best structure data on each one of them.
- I have deployed many web apps with AWS and GCP, but I now tend to favor serverless tools such as Firebase/Supabase, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, or Upstash for the productivity, velocity, and great scalability they provide when starting up.
- I am used to setting up web analytics such as GA4 or Mixpanel with optimization A/B testing tools such as GrowthBook in order to experiment with any hypothesis.
- All my projects use ESlint and Prettier to best organize my code.

## Daily Habits

On a personal level, I am committed to cultivating good habits that positively impact my life.

- I enjoy walking in the morning, at break time, after work, and even after dinner. It’s not only a great way to keep me away from back pain, cancer, and chronic diseases, but it also allows me to rest, meditate and come up with great ideas.
- Whenever I am alone, walking, on the tramway, cooking, or eating, I enjoy listening to audiobooks and video podcasts. It’s one of my favorite habits, as it entertains me and allows me to discover invaluable knowledge.
- When it’s time to work, I have learned to focus on my priorities and to set up achievable goals for the day. I love learning by doing, and this is why I never hesitate to experiment with new ideas, and I’ve learned to interrogate Google, Youtube, StackOverflow, chatGPT, or people around me when I get stuck.
- I am working hard to achieve my goals, but I also know how to relax and enjoy life. I love cooking, especially tasty and healthy Chinese dishes, though I confess I enjoy eating them even more. I love board games and am thrilled to play with my family once in a while. And I also enjoy playing music when I need to let go.
- Last but not least, I love to think. Thus I try to sharpen my understanding of the world whenever I get the chance to engage in meaningful conversations, all while staying relaxed and having fun.
