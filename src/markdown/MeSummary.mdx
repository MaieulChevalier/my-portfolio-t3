# My name's Maïeul and I'm an atomic habits nerd

Thanks to my childhood in Madagascar, one of the poorest and yet most beautiful countries on earth, I have cultivated an open and curious mind that I try to use wisely in order to make a meaningful difference in the world. Today, I am 25, I speak Chinese, English and French fluently, I have been developing web apps for more than 5 years, and I like to think of myself as an entrepreneur.

In 2018, I got hooked on web development and entrepreneurship. I have spent countless hours coding ever since, and I’ve had the chance to start two online businesses that I ultimately failed to scale twice. I have learned a lot from these experiences, especially in web development, but also in project management, marketing, finance, and law, and more generally improved my problem-solving and research skills.

After 5 years of working on projects big and small, I think that my biggest strength resides in my ability to combine my web development skills and my thorough understanding of the lean startup methodology to effectively bring new, scalable, and innovative web-based solutions to market.

## Key Skills

Technically speaking, I think I am best at building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and at iterating toward product-market fit, although I also know a thing or two when it’s time to scale.

- I have worked with javascript and typescript extensively on most of the projects I’ve worked on, and I love using typescript if I can for the safety nets it provides.
- I have built responsive UIs with CSS/SASS and most of the major CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Material UI, Bulma, Tailwind), my favorite one being tailwind for the productivity and flexibility that it brings to create a custom design system.
- I have built different websites with all the major front-end frameworks (React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, Remix, Solid.js, Astro, Qwik), my favorite one still being React for its rich ecosystem, and I love using Next.js with it for the great developer experience that it brings.
- I have built many Node.js APIs both with REST and graphQL, though I recently fell in love with client-server RPC calls (tRPC, Remix, Qwik).
- I have experience with all major DBMS such as SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL), object-oriented databases (MongoDB), graph databases (neo4j), and key/value stores (Redis); I know when to use one and not the other and I have extensive experience on data modeling for each one of them.
- I have deployed many web apps with AWS and GCP, but I now tend to favor serverless tools such as Firebase/Supabase, PlanetScale, CockroachDB, or Upstash, for the productivity, velocity, and great scalability they provide.
- I am used to setting up web analytics such as GA4 or Mixpanel with optimization A/B testing tools such as GrowthBook in order to experiment with any hypothesis.
- All my projects use ESlint and Prettier to best organize my code.

## Daily Habits

On a personal level, I am committed to cultivating good habits that positively impact my life.

- During breakfast, I have cultivated the habit of listening to audiobooks or podcasts. It’s one of my favorite habits, as it allows me to discover invaluable knowledge.
- After a good hot shower where I try to set myself mentally for the day, I enjoy immediately getting work done on one of my top 3 priorities.
- I strive to walk my 10,000 steps on a daily basis. I usually walk in the morning, at break time, after work, or even after dinner. It’s not only a great way to keep me away from back pain, cancer, and chronic diseases, but it also allows me to rest and come up with great ideas.
- Before each walk, I go to the park and do at least 10 pull-ups. I think it's a great exercise to counterbalance upper back pain from sitting in front of a computer every day.
- I am working hard to achieve my goals, but I also know how to have fun and enjoy life. I love cooking, especially tasty and healthy Chinese dishes, though I confess I enjoy eating them even more. I love board games and am thrilled to play with my family once in a while. And I also enjoy playing ping-pong or badminton once in while.
- Last but not least, I love to think. Thus I try to sharpen my understanding of the world whenever I get the chance to engage in meaningful conversations, all while staying relaxed and having fun.
