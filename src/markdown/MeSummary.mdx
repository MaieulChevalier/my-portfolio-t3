# My name's Maïeul and I try to solve big problems

Thanks to my childhood in Madagascar, I’ve become an open-minded person who wants to change the world for the better. Today, I'm 25, I speak French, English, and Chinese fluently, I’m a web developer, and I like to think of myself as an entrepreneur.

Since 2018, I’ve been building web apps and had the chance to start two online businesses and to fail twice to scale. I’ve learned a lot from these experiences, especially as a web developer, but also in project management, marketing, finance, and law, and more generally in problem-solving and research. After 5 years of working on projects big and small, I think I've learned to keep an eye open for new technologies, I’ve fallen in love with problem-solving, and I’ve gained a fairly deep understanding of the web development ecosystem and the lean-startup methodology which I now use rigorously to bring new solutions to market on every project I work on.

On a personal level, I strive to build and keep good habits. During my morning walk, when I cook, when I eat alone, and when I go to work or get back home, I love listening to audiobooks or videos in order to discover new ideas. When I get to work, I’ve learned to try and focus as much as possible on my priorities. I know it’s not as easy as it seems, so I try to take a few minutes at least on a daily basis on my mind maps to help me think, design and prioritize. When it’s time to build, I attempt to solve the big problem first by breaking down tasks as much as possible and by minimizing the time spent on perfectionism. I’m not afraid to try out new things so that I can learn as quickly as possible from my mistakes and fix them. When I’m stuck, I am used to googling things out; I’ve recently learned to find my way around with chatGPT; and I know how to ask for help if I think my teammates can give me some hindsight. With time, I’ve learned the importance of taking small breaks when I feel tired and even a 20-minute nap when I get sleepy. I love finishing my day having attained my goal, and if I have 30 minutes to 1 hour left on the clock, I try to follow online courses or read documentation to sharpen my skills. Last but not least, after a good day of meaningful work, I’ve learned to take a few minutes to meditate and set my goals for tomorrow.
