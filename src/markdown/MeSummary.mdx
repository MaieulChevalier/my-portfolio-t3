# Hello, Bonjour, 你好

 Hey 👋 My name's Maïeul, I love open-source, entrepreneurship, problem-solving, and Chinese cuisine 🍚🥢 


I Build the [𝕏 stack](https://x-stack.vercel.app/signin/) and [Qwik UI](https://qwikui.com/).
I also contribute to [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/) when I can.

Solving real world problems and having a strong positive impact is what drives me the most. 

Lean-startup enthusiast and self-taught web developer since 2018, I've tried my luck at a few entrepreneurial adventures such as building a new kind of social network, creating a French data platform for non-profits, and making an interactive 3D globe app for learning geography. I bled on the GRAND stack (GraphQL, React, Apollo, Neo4j Database), cried on MEVN (Mongo, Express, Vue/Nuxt, Node.js), and actually enjoyed the t3 stack (Next, typescript, tailwind, trpc). But I think we can do better and about 6 months ago, I made the crazy decision to work full-time on open-source to make my vision of the 𝕏 stack - a reality.

Also I can speak Chinese 

Think we could work together? Drop me a message <EmailLink className="text-red-400 underline inline cursor-pointer">by mail</EmailLink> or [via Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maieul-c-087655138/).
