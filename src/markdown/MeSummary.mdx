# My name’s Maïeul, and I try to solve big problems

Today, I'm 25, I speak French, English, and Chinese fluently, I’m a web developer, and I like to think of myself as an entrepreneur.

Thanks to my childhood in Madagascar, I’ve become an optimistic person who wants to change the world for the better. Since 2018, I’ve been building web apps and I’ve had the chance to start two online businesses and to fail twice to scale. I’ve learned a lot from these experiences, especially as a web developer, but also in project management, marketing, finance, and law, and more generally in problem-solving and research. After 5 years of working on projects big and small, I think I've learned to remain open-minded, I’ve fallen in love with problem-solving, and last but not least, I’ve gained a fairly deep understanding of the web development ecosystem and of the lean-startup methodology which I use rigorously to bring new solutions to market. Every day, I listen to audiobooks and videos to discover new ideas when walking or cooking; I mind-map to help me think and design; I build, I code, I research, and I read the docs to learn from experience; and I take a few minutes at least to meditate in order to take a step back.
