My very first React project from ZTM school.

This isn’t much, but this taught me that you can create cool websites with a bit of imagination even when you don’t have much experience with the tools you’re using. I hadn’t used React, javascript, html and css to create a realistic website before that, but this showed me that it isn’t as difficult as it may seem once you know the basics.

As a side note, this minimal setup has also served me as a playground to implement and learn about other technologies such as typescript, PWAs, or Redux.
