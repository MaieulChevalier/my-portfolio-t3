As an entrepreneur, I have learned to think in terms of opportunities and I think that there is a great one in the education market for people who want to learn and remember their geography.

Among the many hypotheses I could test, the idea of an interactive 3D globe particularly got my attention. It actually didn’t seem too hard because there are APIs that facilitate the creation of such an interface. But after exploring this idea for a few days, I quickly realized that the 3D globe would be slow on low-end devices. So I spent a few more days to see if I could fix this, but 3D is hard, and it would either require months of work or using mapboxGL which is expensive and would drive costs up. So about a week in total, I decided to pivot towards another hypothesis.

Thanks to this small project, I feel like I now have a better understanding of the importance of building a Proof Of Concept (POC) and that next time I will be able to reduce the amount of time required to see if a project is technically viable or not, considering the available resources.
