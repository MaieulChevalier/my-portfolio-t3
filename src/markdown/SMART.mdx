As an entrepreneur, I have learned to think in terms of opportunities, and I think that there is a great opportunity in the education market for people who want to remember what they learn more easily.

Among the many hypotheses I could test, the idea of an interactive 3D globe mainly got my attention. It actually didn’t seem too hard because there are APIs that facilitate the creation of such an interface. But after exploring this idea for a few days, I quickly realized that the 3D globe would be slow on low-end devices. So I spent a few more days to see if I could fix this, but 3D is hard, and it would either have required months of work or a non-viable expensive solution. Therefore about a week in total, I decided to pivot toward another hypothesis.

Thanks to this small project, I’ve reinforced my skills in building a Proof Of Concept, next time I will be able to reduce the amount of time required to see if a project is technically viable or not, considering the available resources.
