I spent about 3 years on this project, so this is a long story. The idea was to build a social network for community members to come together and take action on what matters most to them. But long story short, I had been trying to start too big all along and because of this made some big mistakes along the way that eventually cost me a lot of time but taught me so much that I definitely don’t regret in thing. I got incredibly better not only in web development but also in design, project management, marketing, entrepreneurship in general, finance, accounting, and law, and also learned a lot about the social media market.

Thanks to this project, I’ve had the chance to cut my teeth on web development with React for state management, MUI for the UX/UI, Apollo-client and Apollo-server to query the graphQL API, Neo4j as a primary database, Redis for caching and rate limiting, Firebase for authentication, MongoDB as a user store, and even AWS EC2 servers, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Elastic beanstalk auto-scalers and their GCP equivalents for deployment.

In terms of project management and entrepreneurship, I’ve learned to really understand and embrace the lean startup methodology. I’ve learned the hard way that designing an MVP is not an easy task and that you still need to make some research and a POC beforehand. I’ve learned that writing a business plan is by no means a better approach. I’ve learned to market myself and attract early adopters on social media. And I’ve learned to concretely implement the AARR (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral) innovation accounting metrics and split-testing in my codebase.

In three years of working on this project, I’ve also learned a lot about the social media market. You can ask me any question about social networks such as Facebook, Reddit, Tiktok, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, etc., or even crowdfunding apps such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Gofundme, etc., or even online petition apps such as [Change.org](http://Change.org), Avaaz, etc., or event platforms such as Meetup, Eventbrite, etc., chances are I know the answer. The reason is, I spent many weekends, so many weekends in fact it makes me blush, trying to design a better ranking algorithm that could represent the communities better, and also trying to design a better filter for everyone to be able to get rid of the noise.

In all truth, I was a broke student when I first started out. And when you’re broke you often have no choice but to do it yourself. Before I knew it, I had created my own legal entity myself, filed a trademark myself, wrote copyright myself, kept the books myself, and dealt with taxes myself. It was definitely not easy, and you’re right if you regard this as a huge waste of time in itself, but it gave me the chance to wrap my head around the corporate world and I know it will help me in my future enterprises.

Today, I like to think of this adventure as the beginning of a long journey. It may not be a success regarding entrepreneurship, but it is nonetheless the most enriching experience of my life by far. I’ve learned a lot and I’m thankful for it. Every successful entrepreneur has had his share of failures before success and I know I will do better in my next adventure and even better in the one after. I keep on learning from my mistakes and this makes me better every day.
